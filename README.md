Welcome to the Hangman game! Let's get started.

Team Members: Project Manager: Ritesh, Developer: Sujal Garg, Tester: Rohit

Gameplay: You have 6 attempts to guess the word. After each guess, you'll receive feedback on the correctness of the guessed alphabet. Correct guesses will allow the game to progress, while incorrect guesses will prompt you to try again, with an indication of the remaining attempts.

Outcome: Successfully guessing the correct word within the 6 attempts will lead to victory, accompanied by a congratulatory message. Failure to guess the word within the allotted attempts will result in defeat, and the Hangman character will meet his unfortunate demise.
